# Language Detection using Machine Learning 🌐📝

A machine learning project that detects the language of a given text using a **bag-of-words model** and **Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier**.

---

## 📌 Overview

- Built using Python and Scikit-learn
- Uses a bag-of-words approach to convert text into numeric features
- Trains a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier on a dataset of 22,000 text samples
- Achieves **~95.7% accuracy** on test data
- Predicts language for user input in real-time

---

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- Pandas & NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib (optional for visualization)

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository and open the notebook/script
2. Run all cells step by step
3. Enter any text when prompted to predict its language

---

## 📝 Results

- Successfully classifies 23 languages including Hindi, Thai, Dutch, and Tamil
- Quick predictions for user input text
